1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A) I always try to bring the efficient code to  the project. Using Stack Overflow, Flutter/dart documentation
      and refer to developers/creators on Youtube. Sometimes The Syntax is updated by flutter, any
      specific widget/call(function).

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart)
A) ctrl+shift+I is the most frequent keyboard shortcut, It opens window to learn properties of any widget/package/function


3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A) rather than setting layout first work on color typography setting background first(global styling).
