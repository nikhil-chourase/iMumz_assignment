1. Attach a pubspec.yaml file from one of your past flutter projects.
A) Add file to "technical" folder

2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. Explain it in your own words.
A) state management is management of project where we create different dart files and manage properties so that it can available
  in most efficient way possible. suppose a boolean value is created at a bottom layer of widget tree (lower in state management)
  but, the boolean value account for a feature in the app and needs to be used on a top level in the widget tree
   by uplifting/downlifting any property we can make it available to any part of the widget tree.


3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process?
A) I usually encounter bugs while implementing widget inside widgets. for example, when i try to use column inside row vice-versa,
   if i put children/containers inside it sometimes the output result can be stretched. to rectify the bug we generally use expanded widget
   or a well structured widget tree.

How important is it to keep the code readable and clean? What best practices do you follow for structuring and writing code so that it is easy to read?
A) Code readability is important, especially if we are working as a team. I prefer to make my code clean by extracting widgets
   to make code reusable and avoid repeatation also state management is used.
